# Telco Customer Churn Prediction

This repository hosts a comprehensive analysis and predictive modeling project aimed at identifying customers likely to churn from a fictional telecom company in California. The project encompasses exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and the development of a machine learning model to predict customer churn.

## Project Overview

The project tackles the challenge of predicting customer churn, which is a critical metric for any subscription-based business model. By accurately predicting churn, companies can take proactive steps to retain their customers and improve service quality. The dataset used in this study contains various customer attributes, including demographic information, services subscribed to, account details, and churn status.

## Files and Descriptions

- **Telco_Customer_Churn_Feature_Engineering_and_Model_Training.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete analysis, feature engineering steps, and model training process.
- **datasets/**: Folder containing the "Telco-Customer-Churn.csv" dataset used for the analysis.

## Sections of the Project

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Initial examination of the data to understand the general structure, identify numerical and categorical variables, and analyze their characteristics and relationship with the target variable (churn).

2. **Feature Engineering**: Process of creating new features from existing data and transforming variables to improve model performance. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical variables.

3. **Model Training**: Training a CatBoost Classifier model to predict customer churn. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, F1 score, and AUC are used to assess model performance.

## Usage

To replicate the analysis or further explore the dataset:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed, or use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) for an online alternative.
3. Open the `.ipynb` file to view the analysis, feature engineering steps, and model training process.
